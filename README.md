### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a soon-to-be PhD graduate in finance from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a background in econometrics. My expertise lies in distilling meaningful information from large datesets and communicating findings in an understandable language. I am open for opportunities in research driven fields that demand a quantitative approach.
