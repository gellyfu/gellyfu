### Hi there 👋

<!--
**gellyfu/gellyfu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a soon-to-be PhD graduate in finance from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a background in econometrics. My expertise lies in distilling meaningful information from large datesets and communicating findings in an understandable language. I am open for opportunities in research driven fields that demand a quantitative approach.
