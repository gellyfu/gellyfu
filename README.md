### Hey, I'm Gelly!

I am a soon-to-be PhD graduate in finance from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a background in econometrics. My passion lies in distilling meaningful information from large datesets and communicating findings in an understandable language. I am open for collaborations in any field that demands a quantitative approach to answer interesting questions.
